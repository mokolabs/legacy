Hart in "The Silent Man"  Following the hype over its price tag, it soon became known as Grauman''s Million Dollar Theatre, although it was not officially named this until 1922.  The auditorium was built behind the twelve story Edison office building, the exterior is a magnificent example, of a variation of Spanish Rococo style, known as Churrigueresque.  Deeply molded features decorate the theatre entrance and higher up on the facade are heroic figures of the arts, with symbols of western Americana, such as bison head, eagles and longhorn steer skulls, all the work of sculptor Joseph Mora.\r\n\r\nThe auditorium which is 106 feet long and 103 feet wide is decorated in a similar style to the exterior and has a curved proscenium arch 40 feet wide and 40 feet high.  The ceiling has a coffered dome and there are numerous statues and niches.  The organ grilles on the side walls are in the style of Spanish Colonial altar screens.  Architect William Lee Woollett is credited with the design of the interior.  The proscenium, with its flanking columns, and the coffered ceiling, foreshadowed the later design by Woollett for Grauman''s Metropolitan Theatre (later Paramount) which was his most fantastical achievement in movie palace design.  The eclectic, fantasy design of the Million Dollar Theatre in 1918 contrasted with the more conventional, neoclassic look of most movie palaces at that time.  By the end of the 1920''s, exotic themes and atmospherics were the rage in movie palace design, and many early movie palaces looked dated, but the Million Dollar Theatre still looked fresh (and almost a century later, still wows.\r\n\r\nAlthough designed specifically as a movie palace, full stage facilities were installed.  Within two months of opening, Sid Grauman began to stage spectacular prologues prior to the film show on the 35 feet deep stage, which was 103 feet wide.  Seating was provided for 1,400 in the orchestra and 945 in the balcony.  An unusual feature was the positioning of the projection booth at the front of the balcony, rather than the usual position at the rear of the balcony.  This gave a shorter throw to the screen which resulted in a brighter picture.  Initially a small 2 manual, 7 rank Wurlitzer organ was installed and it was opened by Jesse Crawford.  This organ proved to be inadequate, and it was replaced on 23rd December 1918 by a  larger 2 manual 16 rank Wurlitzer organ.  The original organ was transfered to the Rialto Theatre on South Broadway, which Grauman also operated.\r\n\r\nAmong the famous names who attended the opening night were: Jesse L. Lasky, Thomas Ince, Mack Sennett, Hal Roach, Cecil B. DeMille, D.W. Griffith, Mary Pickford, Douglas Fairbanks, Charlie Chaplin and Roscoe ''Fatty'' Arbuckle.\r\n\r\nGrauman sold his interests in his downtown Los Angeles theatres (the Million Dollar, Rialto and Metropolitan-later Paramount) to Paramount-Publix in 1924, in order to focus on Hollywood, notably running the Egyptian Theatre and planning the Chinese Theatre.  In 1929, Paramount transferred the huge chandelier that had been hanging in the short-lived Broadway lobby entrance of Grauman''s Metropolitan Theatre (later Paramount), and hung it in the domed ceiling of the auditorium of the Million Dollar Theatre.  The theatre was leased out to Fox West Coast Theatres briefly, but by 1930 the Great Depression was hurting theatres and they closed it down.  Late in 1930 it was taken over by an independent operator named Lazarus.  By 1941 it was being operated by Popkin & Ringer Bros. who operated nine other theatres in downtown and had their headquarters at the Million Dollar Theatre.\r\n\r\nIn 1945, the theatre was taken over by Metropolitan Theatres, who breathed a new lease of life into the building by presenting live shows starring Billy Holiday, Cab Calloway and Lional Hampton and His Orchestra.  Frank Fouce took over the management of the theatre and from August 30, 1950, the Million Dollar became a film and stage venue exlusively for Spanish speaking audiences.  It was the first downtown Los Angeles theatre to have this policy and stars such as Maria Felix and Delores Del Rio appeared on stage.  During the early 1960''s, the foyer area was ''modernised'' with a drop ceiling suspended, and the walls were covered, all of which hides the original plaster decoration.  From 1975 it was showing new general release films, dubbed into Spanish and live Mexican vaudeville shows one week in every month.  Metropolitan Theatres closed the Million Dollar Theatre on March 1, 1993.\r\n\r\nThe Million Dollar Theatre was immediately taken over by a church and  damage was done by painting over chandeliers and original wall murals with white paint.  The name ''Million Dollar'' was removed from the marquee at this time.  In 1998, the church moved out and along Broadway to the former (Loews) State Theatre and the Million Dollar Theatre was shuttered.\r\n\r\nIn October 2005, the Million Dollar Theatre was leased by former nightclub owner Robert Voskanian and work soon began on a restoration of the theatre.  As of the end of February 2008, one million plus dollars had been spent to refurbish the Million Dollar Theatre.  New marble flooring was installed, the proscenium''s stone archway was refurbished, and the theatre was redecorated with a new red and gold paint scheme.\r\n\r\nThe Million Dollar Theatre reopened on February 28, 2008 with a performance by Mexican singer and Latin Grammy Award winner Pepe Aguilar.

Carved stone serpent heads, seven warrior figures in full head-dress (each representing the god of war, each used to light up after dark!) and celestial symbols and hieroglyphics were designed by artist Francisco Cornejo to ornament the structure designed by architects Morgan, Walls and Clements.  That architectural firm also designed the exteriors of both  the El Capitan Theatre in Hollywood and of the Wiltern Theatre.\r\n\r\nInside every square inch, decor is fantastical Mayan Revival, from the floor paving to the furniture and fixtures.  The entry lobby is a hall of Inscriptions and is coated with hieroglyphics.  The foyer is the Hall of Feathered Serpents,  In the auditorium, the huge central, polychromed plaster and metal chandelier is a replica of an Aztec calendar stone.  The original painted fire safety curtain depicted Mayan jungles and temples, which completed the decorative scheme of the theatre.\r\n\r\nImmediately next door to the Mayan Theatre, at 1060 South Hill Street is the 1,601 seat Belasco Theatre, with an exotic Spanish Conquistador exterior by Morgan, Walls and Clements.  It was operated by Los Angeles based producer Edward Belasco, brother of New York based, David Belasco.  The Belasco Theatre opened on November 11, 1926 for stage shows, the first play being Anita Loos comedy "Gentlemen Prefer Blondes".  Above the lobby is located a large 400 capacity ballroom.  It isn''t eligible for its own page here on Cinema Treasures, as it only briefly showed movies, from 1948 to 1950, accompanied by burlesque.  Over the years, many successful productions were staged with stars such as Helen Hayes and Tallulah Bankhead appearing.  In 1950 it became a church and from 1973 to 1985 a gay church; Metropolitan Community Church.  Since then, it has been available for rent, such as for film shoots.  "Swordfish" with John Travolta (2001) was one of the movies that had location shoots at the Belasco Theatre.\r\n\r\nThe Mayan Theatre, which opened with 1,491 seats, was at first a legitimate theatre, then it showed second run movies.  In the 1940''s, the theatre was a burlesque house and it is rumored that in 1948 a young Marilyn Monroe appeared here.  By the end of the decade it tried arthouse films.  From March 3rd 1950, the Mayan was the crown jewel of Francisco Fouce''s chain of Mexican film venues and the first presentation was - ''Direct from Buenos Aires'' one of Latin America''s biggest stars Libertad Lamarque, ''live on stage and on the screen''.  The theatre became an adult porn theatre in the early 1970''s (some of the films were shot in the basement of the theatre) and around 1977 it was converted into a triple-screen theatre, still screening adult movies.\r\n\r\nThe auditorium has now been de-tripled and the current nightclub use, replete with the theatre''s original exotic Mayan interior, opened February 1990 and renamed The Mayan.\r\n\r\nShowcasing the theatre itself, including its exotic interior, are movies including the murder mystery, set in a theatre;Reginald Denny in "It Couldn''t Have Happened-But It Did" (1936), "Save the Tiger" with Jack Lemmon (1973) and "The Bodyguard" with Kevin Costner (1992).

Hollywood Theatre opened April 26, 1928, with Conrad Nagel and Dolores Costello in "Glorious Betsy".  The theatre was built within an office building and the auditorium is located on a diagonal axis facing north-east at the rear  There was a second entrance to the west of the theatre on Wilcox Street.  Other movie palaces built in Los Angeles designed by G. Albert Lansburgh included the current downtown Orpheum Theatre (1926) and the Wiltern Theatre.\r\n\r\nThis opulent movie palace was as close to an atmospheric theatre as Los Angeles ever had.  It was built in a semi-atmospheric style without the twinkling stars and clouds.  A colonnade of wide Italianite style arches on the auditorium side walls contained painted scenes of exotic landscapes on the walls between the arches, giving a sense of being in an open garden.  The original painted asbestos safety curtain by famous artist John B. Smeraldi had ''a fanciful scene of birds of paradise performing a mating dance in a forest of delicate trees and blossoms, painted over gold leaf''.  Design styles included Renaissance Revival, Rococo, and Moorish.  The theatre had a seating capacity of 2,756 in orchestra and balcony.  A 4 manual, 28 rank Marr & Colton organ was relocated here from the Piccadilly Theatre in New York, where Warner Bros. premiered "The Jazz Singer".  The two ''dirigible'' radio masts on top of the theatres office building were added soon after the Warner Hollywood Theatre opened.  The office space on the upper left of the building had become the radio studios for KFWB and these were illuminated with letters pronouncing the theatre''s name and the radio station code name letters. \r\n\r\nIn the 1940''s, Carol Burnett worked as a Warner usher and she now has her own star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame right outside the theatre.\r\n\r\nFrom 1953 to 1961 and 1962 to 1964, three-strip Cinerama was shown and it was renamed the Warner Cinerama Theatre.  The auditorium walls were covered up with drapes and chunks of plaster were taken off parts of the proscenium arch to accommodate the huge screen.  A lower suspended ceiling was installed at this time.  The World Premiere of "This Is Cinerama" played for 133 weeks from May 1953 to 1955.  "Cinerama Holiday" played for 81 weeks from 1955 to 1957.  "Seven Wonders of the World" played for 69 weeks from 1957 to 1958.  "South Seas Adventure" played for 71 weeks from 1958 to 1960.  "How the West Was Won" (1963) played for 93 weeks.\r\n\r\nDuring the 80 week run of "2001, A Space Odyssey" in 70mm, which had its West Coast premiere here on April 4, 1968, the theatre changed hands from Stanley Warner to Pacific Theatres and was renamed the Hollywood Pacific Theatre.\r\n\r\n"A Clockwork Orange" (1972) also was among movies that had a very successful run.  On 31st January 1978, after a run of Clint Eastwood in "The Gauntlet", the Pacific theatre closed.  It was converted into a triple-screen theatre with 1,250 seats in the former orchestra level and two 550 seat screens in the former balcony.  The main screen and screen 3 in the balcony were both equipped to play 70mm film.  It re-opened later in 1978.  The awesome original decorations in the semi-circular lobby was not disturbed.\r\n\r\nThere are two main reasons for the Pacific Theatre''s eventual closure, the disruption due to the Metro subway construction along Hollywood Boulevard and on January 17, 1994 when the theatre suffered damage due to the Northridge Earthquake.  This caused the two balcony screens to be closed due to concern over public safety. The Pacific Theatre closed on August 15, 1994.  It remained shuttered and unused until 2002 when the main floor auditorium was used by the Entertainment Technology Center as a testing facility for the new digital projection revolution.  They had departed from the building by 2006 and in early 2008, it was being used by a church on Sundays.  The balcony areas are still inaccessible to the attendees.\r\n\r\nThe theatre has been designated a Historic-Cultural Monument.  With the redevelopment of Hollywood Boulevard underway, the theatre has now been highlighted in the evenings by new illumination on the radio masts on top of the building.

The Rialto opened for vaudeville and movies on October 17, 1925, with Ray Metcalfe playing the 2 manual, 10 rank Wurlitzer pipe organ and with the Rialto Orchestra accompanying the world premiere of Universal''s "What Happened to Jones" starring Reginald Denny.  A Franchon and Marco stage show included Trapeze artists and vaudeville acts.  Admission was 30 cents.  The Rialto Theatre was one of the last theatres to be designed by noted theatre architect Lewis A. Smith, who died the following year.  It is decorated in a mix of several styles, mainly Moorish, but there are elements of Egyptian, Spanish Baroque and Classical features too, all contributing to the Jazz Age charm of this theatre.\r\n\r\nThe Rialto Theatre was built by local showman L. Lou Bard, who had an Egyptian interior in each of his showplaces.  His other ''Bard''s'' were the Vista (Bard''s Hollywood-1923), still a single screen showing movies in Hollywood, the Academy (Bard''s Egyptian-1924) now a six-plex in Pasadena, Bard''s Glendale-1924 in Glendale (now demolished), and Bard''s  West Adams-1925 at Crenshaw & Adams(now a church).  All were designed by Lewis A. Smith, whose famed theatres also included the recently demolished Arabian style Beverley Theatre, Beverley Hills.  South Pasadena had one other theatre, the Ritz (opened as the Colonial), nearby at 804 Fair Oaks, but demolished by the 1960''s.\r\n\r\nOriginal seating for the Rialto Theatre was about 1,200 including a balcony.  The auditorium has a colorful stenciling, plaster ornamentation, and organ chambers supported by mythical creatures called harpies.  A gargoyle sits high above the proscenium with red glowing eyes that illuminate even during film shows.\r\n\r\nThe Jebbia family has owned the theatre since the 1930''s and it was operated by West Coast Theatres (Fox).  Ticket buyers during the Great Depression could play the miniature golf course that was in the theatre.  A back stage fire occurred in 1938.  In 1941 it was operated by Circle Theatres Ltd. a subsidiary of Fox West Coast Theatres.\r\n\r\nIn the 1960''s it was leased to Mann Theatres and legendary organ concerts were given by George Wright during this time.  The grille on the left organ chamber was damaged when the fire department aimed lots of water at it, to put out a fire that resulted in the removal of the pipe organ.\r\n\r\nIn 1977, South Pasadena citizens circulated petitions to save the Rialto from demolition to create a parking lot.  The Rialto Theatre was designated a local listing of Historic Cultural Monument in 1977.  It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1978.\r\n\r\nSucceeding Mann as movie operators, Landmark Theatres took over in 1976 and showed arthouse and classic movies here.  In the 1990''s many moviegoers were alarmed at Landmark''s plan to multiplex the interior.\r\n\r\nThe Rialto Theatre, including its interior, has itself starred in many movies and commercials.  The back alley of the Rialto was used in the Robert Altman film "The Player" (1992) during the murder scene.  "Scream 2" (1997) also featured the theatre.  The theatre has a display of historic memorabilia in the lobby.  Gorgeous photographs of its auditorium are included in the 1997 book "The Last Remaining Seats, Movie Palaces of Tinseltown".\r\n\r\nLandmark celebrated the 75th Anniversary with a birthday bash on Friday, October 27, 2000, with a large cake, vaudeville, opera, Shakespeare and a showing of the Marx Bros. classic "Duck Soup".  Additional celebrations in October and November of that year included a new print of Tim Burton''s "Nightmare Before Christmas", a one week classic film festival (Casablanca", "The Wizard of Oz", "Gone With the Wind", "Once Upon a Time in the West" and "Citizen Kane") and one week of ''Los Angeles in the Movies'' (Sunset Boulevard", "Singing in the Rain", "Double Indemnity" and "Shampoo").\r\n\r\nLandmark closed the Rialto Theatre with "The Simpson Movie" on August 19, 2007.  Then, on December 29, 2007, a farewell performance of "The Rocky Horror Picture Show" was held, concluding three decades of the cult favorite being presented at the theatre as a midnight feature.\r\n\r\nLocated near Mission Street, which has coffee houses, antique stores and restaurants, the Rialto Theatre has long been the heart of South Pasadena.  Like all old theatres, this one now needs new seats and carpet, revamped heating and air conditioning, and repainting to its original paint scheme.  In "Sunset Boulevard", former silent movie star Norma Desmond, played by Gloria Swanson, could not resurrect her career, but this Silent Era Hollywood gem can be refurbished and reopened like so many historic theatres that have been restored and reopened nationwide.  For the Rialto Theatre to be demolished would be a heartbreaking loss for South Pasadena and for the Los Angeles region.

Toberman recruited Sid Grauman to open the first of the grand Hollywood movie palaces and in 1920 when it was first announced, the plans were for it to be designed in a Spanish style.  The Egyptian cost $800,000, was constructed over 18 months and had a seating capacity of 1,771(all on one level).  The Egyptian theme was chosen for the name and decor to take advantage of the excitement drawn by the discoveries and searches in Egypt for ancient artifact such as King Tutankhamen''s tomb (which was discovered by Englishman Howard C. Carter on 26th November 1922;five weeks after the Egyptian Theatre opened).  Architects Mendel Meyer & Phillip W. Holler of the Milwaukee Building Co. designed the building with decorator Raymond M. Kennedy in charge of decorative details.  This theatre was among the first of many Egyptian Revival style theatres in the US.\r\n\r\n"Robin Hood" was shown at the first ever ''Hollywood Premiere'' at the grand opening of Grauman''s Egyptian Theatre on October 18, 1922 and continued to be screened until the 1st week of April 1923.  The next attraction was "The Covered Wagon" followed by "The Ten Commandments" which premiered at the theatre on December 4, 1923.  This was followed by "The Thief of Bagdad" and all had long runs, in fact Grauman''s Egyptian Theatre only played four movies in its first three years of operation.  Grauman also presented an elaborate live stage show ''Prologue'' with each performance of the movies.\r\n\r\nAfter Grauman departed the Egyptian in 1927 to open Grauman''s Chinese Theatre along the Boulevard, Fox West Coast Theatres operated the Egyptian as a re-run house.  In 1944, the Egyptian became the exclusive Hollywood showcase for MGM and it became a first-run premiere house again.\r\n\r\nA large curved Todd A-O screen was installed for the Roadshow engagement in 70mm of "Oklahoma" which had its West Coast Premiere on November 17, 1955.  Sadly the installation of the huge 75feet wide screen led to the demolition of the elaborate original Egyptian style proscenium arch.  A new projection suite was built at seating level in the rear of the orchestra seating and the auditorium walls were covered in yellow drapes.  It was most likely that it was at this period of time that the original Wurlitzer 3Manual/15Ranks organ was removed from the building.\r\n\r\nAdditional West Coast Premiere''s and engagements of 70mm movies included "South Pacific"(May 21, 1958, and was shown for more than one year), "Ben Hur"(November 24, 1959 and ran for two years), "King of Kings"(October 12, 1959), "Mutiny on the Bounty"(November 15, 1962), "The Cardinal"(December 19, 1963), "My Fair Lady"(October 28, 1964 and ran for more than a year), "Hawaii"(October 12, 1966), "Funny Girl"(October 9, 1968 and was the last of the long Road Show presentations), and "The Poseidon Adventure"(December 14, 1972).  The World Premier in 70mm of "Marooned" was held December 12, 1969.\r\n\r\nFrom 1949 until it closed in 1992, United Artists were the operator of the Egyptian Theatre.  From the 1970''s, 20th Century Fox movies were showcased.  In 1969 a huge curved movie screen of about 90 feet wide was installed.  United Artists added two small auditoriums in what had been a store on the east side rear of the theatre.\r\n\r\nIn its last years United Artists were  operating the Egyptian as a last run discount house with $1.50 admission.\r\n\r\nAfter closing in 1992, the building was shuttered and was badly damaged in the 1994 Northridge earthquake.  The City of Los Angeles had purchased the theatre a few months before the earthquake and so that it could be re-opened, ownership was transferred for $1.00 to the American Cinematheque.  This classic movie theatre was given a stylish multi-million dollar make-over and renovation.  The palm tree lined forecourt was restored to its original grandeur.  The interior was renovated with solid, minimalist quality and state of the art technology.  The main auditorium named for philanthropist Lloyd E. Ringler was reopened with its original, ornate sunburst ceiling and 616 seats.  A second theatre named after donor Steven Spielberg, is downstairs, and has 78 seats.\r\n\r\nA key part of the revitalization of Hollywood Boulevard, the theatre reopened to the public, appropriately, with "The Prince of Egypt".

Theatre designer Joseph Musil, who also redesigned the El Capitan in Hollywood and the Crest in Westwood, brought his colorful theatrical flair to the new Cecchi Gori Fine Arts.  The lobby has been further enlarged by moving in the back wall of the auditorium.  A new 14'' by 33'' screen was installed several feet in front of the old proscenium to accommodate wider aspect ratios. This re-configuring, and the use of somewhat wider seats, reduced the theatre''s capacity to 410.  The Cecci Gori people originally wanted an Italian street scene painted onto the screen curtain, but later decided against it.  That is is why there is a flat black curtain instead of traditional gathered drapes.  \r\n\r\nTwo stores that flanked the theatre were converted into a full concession stand and an expansion of the ladies room (no ''theatrette'', just more toilets). The box office window is now located between the front entrance doors. Changes to the interior have been substantial enough to make it difficult to attribute the theatre''s current overall look to any one person, although Joseph Musil''s design touches are everywhere.  The theatre''s original marquee and facade remain essentially unaltered.\r\n\r\nThe Fine Arts was leased to Screening Services Group and reopened in December 2005 with the US premiere of "Mrs. Henderson Presents."  Primarily a rental venue, the theatre has been equipped to handle multiple film and video formats, including 2K Digital Cinema, and Dolby Digital EX.
