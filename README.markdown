Migrating Legacy Data sample app
================================

This is a sample application that shows how to migrate legacy data into a Rails app, as demonstrated in Episode 15 of the SD Ruby Podcast.

IMPORTANT: If you need to migrate legacy data, check out my new [Trucker gem](http://github.com/mokolabs/trucker) and the [sample application](http://github.com/mokolabs/trucker_sample_app) that uses Trucker. It provides an improved method for migrating legacy data, which builds on the technique outlined in this app and the original SD Ruby talk.
